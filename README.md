# Pi Approximation with Svelte, Rust, and Docker Compose

This project is a solution to the task of approximating the number Pi using the Monte Carlo method. It consists of a Svelte frontend and a Rust backend, orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Task Description

The goal is to design a simple front- and backend system to approximate the number Pi (Ï€) as accurately as possible.

### Workflow

1.  The user inputs a number of random points to generate into the frontend and clicks a "Send" button.
2.  The frontend sends a request to the backend, specifying the desired number of points.
3.  The backend generates the specified number of random 2D points where each coordinate `x` is in the range `[0, 1]`.
4.  The backend sends the generated points back to the frontend.
5.  The frontend uses these points to calculate an approximation of Pi using the Monte Carlo method and displays the result to the user.

### Requirements

-   The number of requested points must be adjustable by the user.
-   The points must be generated by the backend.
-   The calculation of Pi must take place in the frontend.

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

### Instructions

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This command will build and start the Svelte frontend and the Rust backend in separate containers.

Once running, you can access the frontend in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
